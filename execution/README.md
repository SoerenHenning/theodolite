# Requirements


## Kubernetes Cluster

For executing benchmarks, access to Kubernetes cluster is required. We suggest
to create a dedicated namespace for executing our benchmarks. The following
services need to be available as well.

### Prometheus

We suggest to use the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator)
and create a dedicated Prometheus instance for these benchmarks.

If Prometheus Operator is not already available on your cluster, a convenient
way to install is via the [**unofficial** Prometheus Operator Helm chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator).
As you may not need an entire cluster monitoring stack, you can use our Helm
configuration to only install the operator:

```sh
helm install prometheus-operator stable/prometheus-operator -f infrastructure/prometheus/helm-values.yaml
```

After installation, you need to create a Prometheus instance:

```sh
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/prometheus/prometheus.yaml
```

You might also need to apply the [ServiceAccount](infrastructure/prometheus/service-account.yaml), [ClusterRole](infrastructure/prometheus/cluster-role.yaml) 
and the [CusterRoleBinding](infrastructure/prometheus/cluster-role-binding.yaml),
depending on your cluster's security policies.

For the individual benchmarking components to be monitored, [ServiceMonitors](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator#customresourcedefinitions)
are used. See the corresponding sections below for how to install them.

### Grafana

As with Prometheus, we suggest to create a dedicated Grafana instance. Grafana
with our default configuration can be installed with Helm:

```sh
helm install grafana stable/grafana -f infrastructure/grafana/values.yaml
```

The official [Grafana Helm Chart repository](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana)
provides further documentation including a table of configuration options.

We provide ConfigMaps for a [Grafana dashboard](infrastructure/grafana/dashboard-config-map.yaml) and a [Grafana data source](infrastructure/grafana/prometheus-datasource-config-map.yaml).

Create the Configmap for the dashboard:

```sh
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/grafana/dashboard-config-map.yaml
```

Create the Configmap for the data source:

```sh
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/grafana/prometheus-datasource-config-map.yaml
```

### A Kafka cluster

One possible way to set up a Kafka cluster is via [Confluent's Helm Charts](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts).
For using these Helm charts and conjuction with the Prometheus Operator (see
below), we provide a [patch](https://github.com/SoerenHenning/cp-helm-charts)
for these helm charts. Note that this patch is only required for observation and
not for the actual benchmark execution and evaluation.

**TODO** Add required configuration, installation

### The Kafka Lag Exporter

Lightbend's Kafka Lag Exporter can be installed via helm:

``sh
helm install kafka-lag-exporter https://github.com/lightbend/kafka-lag-exporter/releases/download/v0.6.0/kafka-lag-exporter-0.6.0.tgz
``

**TODO** Add configuration + ServiceMonitor
=======
#### Our patched Confluent Helm Charts

To use our patched Confluent Helm Charts clone the
[chart's repsoitory](https://github.com/SoerenHenning/cp-helm-charts). We also
provide a [default configuration](infrastructure/kafka/values.yaml). If you do
not want to deploy 10 Kafka and 3 Zookeeper instances, alter the configuration
file accordingly. To install Confluent's Kafka and use the configuration:

```sh
helm install my-confluent <path-to-cp-helm-charts> -f infrastructure/kafka/values.yaml
```

To let Prometheus scrape Kafka metrics, deploy a ServiceMonitor:

```sh
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kafka/service-monitor.yaml
```

#### Other options for Kafka

Other Kafka deployments, for example, using Strimzi, should work in similiar way.

### The Kafka Lag Exporter

[Lightbend's Kafka Lag Exporter](https://github.com/lightbend/kafka-lag-exporter)
can be installed via Helm. We also provide a [default configuration](infrastructure/kafka-lag-exporter/values.yaml).

```sh
helm install kafka-lag-exporter https://github.com/lightbend/kafka-lag-exporter/releases/download/v0.6.0/kafka-lag-exporter-0.6.0.tgz -f infrastructure/kafka-lag-exporter/values.yaml
```

## Python 3.7

<<<<<<< HEAD
For executing benchmarks and analyzing their results, a Python 3.7 installation
is required. We suggest to use a virtual environment placed in the `.venv` directory.

**TODO** Show how to install requirements
=======
For executing benchmarks and analyzing their results, a **Python 3.7** installation
is required. We suggest to use a virtual environment placed in the `.venv` directory.

As set of requirements is needed for the analysis Jupyter notebooks and the
execution tool. You can install them with the following command (make sure to
be in your virtual environment if you use one):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```


## Required Manual Adjustments

Depending on your setup, some additional adjustments may be necessary:

* Change Kafka and Zookeeper servers in the Kubernetes deployments (uc1-application etc.) and `run_XX.sh` scripts
* Change Prometheus' URL in `lag_analysis.py`
* Change the path to your Python 3.7 virtual environment in the `run_XX.sh` schripts (to find the venv's `bin/activate`)
* Change the name of your Kubernetes namespace for [Prometheus' ClusterRoleBinding](infrastructure/prometheus/cluster-role-binding.yaml)
* *Please let us know if there are further adjustments necessary*



# Execution

The `./run_loop.sh` is the entrypoint for all benchmark executions. Is has to be called as follows:

```sh
./run_loop.sh <use-case> <wl-values> <instances> <partitions> <cpu-limit> <memory-limit> <commit-interval> <duration>
```

* `<use-case>`: Stream processing use case to be benchmarked. Has to be one of `1`, `2`, `3` or `4`.
* `<wl-values>`: Values for the workload generator to be tested, separated by commas. For example `100000, 200000, 300000`.
* `<instances>`: Numbers of instances to be benchmarked, separated by commas. For example `1, 2, 3, 4`.
* `<partitions>`: Number of partitions for Kafka topics. Optional. Default `40`.
* `<cpu-limit>`: Kubernetes CPU limit. Optional. Default `1000m`.
* `<memory-limit>`: Kubernetes memory limit. Optional. Default `4Gi`.
* `<commit-interval>`: Kafka Streams' commit interval in milliseconds. Optional. Default `100`.
* `<duration>`: Duration in minutes subexperiments should be executed for. Optional. Default `5`.
